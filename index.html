			<p>ASUU’s position was declared at a public lecture titled: ‘Exploring Radical Remedies for the Root of Pervasive Insecurity in Contemporary Nigeria’ delivered at the university by the union’s trustee and past ASUU Chairman, Professor Asisi Asobie.

Asobie said that the relegation of Nigeria universities to the background by the government, which has resulted in persistent strike actions by lecturers, has made the citadel of learning unable to produce necessary research to combat insecurity in the country.

He said: “Furthermore, the Nigeria state has not yet earned the monopoly of the legitimacy of the possession, control, and use of the instruments of coercion in the society.” 

“Moreover, the Nigeria state lacks relative autonomy; its dominant class, an alliance of indigenous middlemen or communisation agents and foreign merchants and speculative investors is not independent of social groups and heir parochial interests, and criminal activities. It is therefore unable to enforce the law of the land against criminality.”

“Also, Nigerian economy is a casino capitalist economy embedded in a globalising world capitalist system. It therefore partakes of certain features of this contemporary globalization which make it promotional of criminality and therefore insecurity.”

He said that enduring solution to pervasive insecurity in contemporary Nigeria can only found by addressing its roots, adding that the three main sources of insecurity have some common roots.

 “They are the nature of the Nigerian state, the nature of the Nigerian economy, and the Nigeria social order and its legal order or justice system,” he said.

Represented by former National Chairman of ASUU, Professor Nasir Fagge, Jega said the union will continue to press for the improvement of living conditions in Nigeria, especially among youths. He said that UNIJOS ASUU is leading in the crusade for positive change in terms of providing employment.

Also speaking, Vice-Chancellor of UNIJOS, Prof Tanko Ishaya, said that the funding model for higher education in the country is completely flawed, and cannot take the country far. He commended the former leaders of the union that fought hard to achieve TETFund that has helped the public universities in diverse ways.

The VC assured ASUU of the commitment of the University towards providing the enabling environment to advance their welfare.

Present at the lecture were former and current National Chairmen of ASUU including Prof. Fagge, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi and Prof Emmanuel Osodeke. Zonal and chapter chairmen of the union from across the country were equally present.

	    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo's most recent Ballon d'Or triumph came in 2017. The Portuguese won the accolade following his unbelievable performances for Real Madrid in 2016-17. That campaign, the Merengues became the first team to successfully defend their UEFA Champions League title.

Since then, the winger has gone over three years without claiming the prestigious honour. The winner of the 2021 Ballon d'Or award will be announced in less than two weeks, but Ronaldo definitely isn't one of the favourites to win it. His eternal rival Lionel Messi, Bayern Munich sharpshooter Robert Lewandowski ahead Ronaldo in this year's race..<br>Also, Journalist Fabrizio Romano stated: “His contract is valid for another year and his hope is to stay at Manchester United, but only if Erik ten Hag is really sure he can believe in Cristiano as the key player for next season’s team.”

Cristiano Ronaldo wants to stay at United and will have to meet with new manager Erik ten Hag this summer to discuss his participation in the team.

Romano finishes by claiming: “My understanding is also that Cristiano would have no problem accepting the arrival of another striker on the market – Man United will 100% sign a new central striker but this is not linked to the future of Cristiano Ronaldo. There is an obvious need to replace Edinson Cavani, whose contract is about to expire, while there are also issues with players like Rashford and Martial, who aren’t providing enough goals for the club at the moment.”<br>

<p>Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; formerly stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[2] Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass, and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres.<br>Eminem made his debut in the film industry with the musical drama film 8 Mile (2002), playing a fictionalized version of himself, and his track "Lose Yourself" from its soundtrack won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award.[4] Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009) and The Interview (2014) and the television series Entourage (2010). He has also developed other ventures, including Shady Records, a joint venture with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf and Obie Trice, among others. He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil.</strong></p></div>
